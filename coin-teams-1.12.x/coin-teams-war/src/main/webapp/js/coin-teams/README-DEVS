We follow the Douglas Crockford Code Conventions:
http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html

We use the 'Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture' by Nicholas C. Zakas:
Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/scalable-javascript-application-architecture
Video: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=zakas-architecture
Google Clojure library based example library: http://github.com/legalbox/lb_js_scalableApp
NOTE: We don't strive for library independence, 
      it's fine for a module to depend on jQuery.
      Or we might cry... ;).

If you don't know JavaScript, please take the time to learn the language:

Remember, !JavaScript.equals(Java) && !JavaScript.equals(PHP).
