1. UNPACK TARBALL
=================

Unpack the provided tarball on the server that you want to deploy
the application on. e.g. extract the tarball in /tmp


2. PREPARE TOMCAT
=================

This installation document only provides documentation for the Tomcat 
application server.

If you already have deployed a previous version of the COIN Teams application
you must follow step 2.2 to undeploy the previous version

2.1	Stop Tomcat

Stop the tomcat application server

2.2	Undeploy a previous version (optional)

Navigate to the '<<CATALINA_HOME>>/webapps/<<GUI-VIRTUAL-HOST-DIRECTORY>>'
(e.g. /opt/tomcat/webapps/gui.dev.coin.surf.net)
delete the 'coin-teams-war-<<VERION>>.war' file. 
(e.g. coin-teams-war-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war)

2.3	Copy / edit property files

Out-of-the-box the tarball comes with a number of different property files. 
A number of property files are delivered:
coin-teams properties
- coin-teams.properties
- coin-teams.properties.acc
- coin-teams.properties.prod
- coin-teams.properties.test

grouper-client properties
- grouper.client.properties
- grouper.client.properties.acc
- grouper.client.properties.prod
- grouper.client.properties.test

For different environments different property files are delivered. Pick the 
appropriate property files (one coin-teams and one grouper.client property file) for your environment from the following directory:
<<EXTRACTED_TAR_BALL_PATH>>/tomcat/conf/classpath_properties

Copy the chosen property files to <<CATALINA_HOME>>/conf/classpath_properties

Edit the values of the property files according to your environment.


3. DEPLOY WAR FILE
==================

Copy the provided context descriptor from 
<<EXTRACTED_TAR_BALL_PATH>>/tomcat/conf/context
to 
<<CATALINA_HOME>>/conf/Catalina/<<GUI-VIRTUAL-HOST-DIRECTORY>>
(e.g. /opt/tomcat/conf/Catalina/gui.dev.coin.surf.net)

Now, copy the coin-portal war located at
<<EXTRACTED_TAR_BALL_PATH>>/tomcat/webapps
to
<<CATALINA_HOME>>/webapps/<<GUI-VIRTUAL-HOST-DIRECTORY>>
(e.g. /opt/tomcat/webapps/gui.dev.coin.surf.net)


4. START TOMCAT
===============

Start tomcat again.
